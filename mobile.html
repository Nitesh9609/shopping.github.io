        <h2>Redmi Note 5 Pro Summary</h2>
        
        <p class="double">  The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro features a metal chassis and a 5.99-inch, full-HD+ display with Gorilla Glass.<br> The design is a bit plain but the build and finish is good. The display also has very good levels of brightness and colours are nice and punchy. <br>This is the first phone to feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 SoC, which offers plenty of power for gaming and heavy apps. <br>You can choose between either 4GB or 6GB of RAM but the storage is the same, at 64GB. Camera performance is also good.<br> The Note 5 Pro features a Portrait mode too for the front and rear camera, which works well.<br> Battery life is also very good, as the phone easily lasts for an entire day on a single charge and fast charging is also supported although you'll have to buy a fast charger separately.</p>
